    This piece is layered. Skin, flesh, sinews. Ribcage, lungs, heart. Layers upon layers protecting the root of our life, the light that shines within. This piece is fragile. The surface layers especially are easily broken, although the ribcage stands strong and structured. This piece is modifiable. Each layer can stand alone, complete in its own way, or they can be adjusted to a different (unnatural) order. 
    <br />
    <br />
    Starting off the series with a traditional interpretation of Inorganic Anatomy, “Cavernous (Carnivorous)” mirrors the cavern that is the human body, inviting the viewer in to explore its mysteries. But is it a trap? Will you trip over the winding roots and hanging vines and fall, exposed to the inner dangers. Like a carnivorous plant, will the cavern engulf you so you fail to exist? 
    <br />
    <br />
    This piece represents a fresh start for a new semester, with none of the thematic elements from my previous series. I’ve wanted to try making art with paper-cutting since middle school, when a visiting artist showed us her incredibly intricate scenes of paper cuttings. I have some previous experience with the medium from making decorations during Lunar New Year, but I’ve never been so intentional about details. This process was a new experience because I had to think in different ways to work with negative space and consider the layering visuals of the work overall. I made purposeful decisions, like with the limited choice of colors and the slight elevations with foam board. While this work is still viewed 2-dimensionally, the elevation and layers add that 3-dimensional aspect that will be integral to this new series.

    “Stacked Children” is not my first work with clay, but it made me fall in love with the medium. Inspired by Johnson Tsang’s baby faces, I went into this work with very little idea of what I wanted to do besides the medium and the artist I wanted to emulate. Working 3-dimensionally to mold faces out of a plain ball of clay gives a type of higher power that comes with creating; this is the most attached I’ve been to an art piece in a while. Seeing the faces come to form and customizing their expressions made me really happy. With working in 3D, I had to learn how to work from all angles and experiment with the figure, specifically parts of the body that I don’t usually work with (limbs, torso, etc.). While the process was a little frustrating, with the fragility of the clay and weight distribution issues causing some problems, the end product was very rewarding. I’ve been told the babies are a little creepy; they’re not really human, and their expressions give them a somewhat surreal feeling, similar to the drawings of Yoshitomo Nara. But I think these slightly dysmorphic expressions represent both my art-style and the theme of this series: Inorganic Anatomy- the body unnaturally: distorted, strained, inhuman.

    “Thoughts in Head” is a visual representation of our One Photo a Day assignment. In the modern age, if you go to a concert, you’ll see most people on their phones recording. The urge to capture memories digitally is extreme. I have an intense attachment to my photos. If my phone were to break, those would be the only things I really miss. Digital photos are a stronger form of memory. And we are made up of our memories. This piece demonstrates how I, as a collective whole, am made up of the small instances of each day, the parts of my day that stand out enough to be included in my one photo. Like a digital journal, this piece collects the most significant moments/people of my recent years, as well as some photos that show the simplicity of daily routines. It's a different interpretation of inorganic anatomy– the“inorganic” (digital) representation of my internal workings, my inner make-up. The photos, each too small to be noticed individually, collectively form a self-portrait. The self-portrait photo is unlike my previous self-portraits, a version of myself different from what I typically portray. 
    <br />

    It took me a while to decide what I wanted to do with this piece. I knew I wanted to do a collage, and I was originally going to do something directly inspired by Stefan Yordanov and the human form. But then there were issues with what images to use, color payoff and paper quality, and the meaning behind the piece. So I decided to make it more personal. Using my own images, I no longer wanted to do a full body piece. I decided to think back to one of my 36 Apples from the start of the year and make a collective image. It took a lot longer than expected. I’ve never done a collage like this before, and so I was really winging it, trying hard to make sure the colors didn’t all blend together. I had to be very deliberate, especially because the piece was quite fragile. Surprisingly, I didn’t plan the pictures at all yet used every part of every picture I printed; I only got intentional with the images I was printing towards the end to fill in the hair. I think the final product is really cool, but I don’t think I’ll be doing anything similar anytime soon, at least on this scale. I don’t think this work needed to be so big– since I didn’t do the originally planned full body, the piece ended up being larger than life.

    *Its twisting lips, all-engulfing, stretch open to swallow you alive.* Teresa Duck, my previous Sunday Papers artist, melds human anatomy with flowers, similar to elements I used in my previous series. For this project, I decided to take a different approach to the incorporation of plants. Of all carnivorous plants, venus flytraps have always reminded me the most of humans, with their eerily grinning mouths and skin reminiscent of human flesh. They’re cavernous– I would have named this piece *Cavernous (Carnivorous)* had I not already used it. Originally, I was going to draw the connection between the plant and flesh by using the patterns of human muscle that you see in the anatomical drawings. But as I was drawing the head, I realized how brain-like it was. So I ran with it. The head became the brain. The body, stem / vines, became neurons / dendrites, like complex tree branches tangled together. The roots of life became a different form of the root of our life. While plants are organic, they aren’t considered “alive” in the same way we are– this work, with its model being the most human-like venus flytrap, also presents the question of plant sentience and moral responsibility.

    Although not anatomically correct, this piece is inherently inorganic in its medium. It’s another piece whose value lies in the process. I’m not very familiar with digital art in general, and I’ve never used digital modeling as an art form. So the process of becoming familiar with the tools was a big step for me. Everytime I work with digital art, I get overwhelmed by the power you have- the tools, shortcuts, hacks; it intimidates me. I tried to take it slow, watching tutorials and only using beginner tools. It was a really enjoyable experience, and I am proud of what came out of it. I tried to add a lot of detail with the clay buildup and slash tools that may not come through the quality and rendering of the model, like the hashing or cuts/warts/texture on the head. I added this texture all over the body as well for cohesion. While I’m aware that my work is probably in that beginner stage where it looks good to the untrained eye but holds many possible areas for improvement in the form/composition or details/texture, I am proud of how I grew comfortable during this process, both with the tool and making mistakes (using Command Z over and over again). 
    <br />
    <br />
    The tool I used is mainly for character design– I hope in the future to create a whole, more complete scene. I also really wish I could add color to this work, but the tool doesn’t allow for it. It’s free and for beginners, so there are lots of limitations in how much I can do. I also think 3D printing would be cool in theory, but I know from experience that it wouldn’t capture the detail and wouldn’t work well structurally. I also don’t like 3D printing material/art in general. Therefore, I think this piece is best kept and viewed digitally.
