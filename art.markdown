In addition to my work in computer science, I have a strong interest in visual art and creative expression. Drawing and paiting have been long-time passions of mine, and they often influence how I approach problems and new situations. This page leads to a collection of personal artwork — a creative outlet that complements my technical projects and reflects the visual side of how I engage with the world creatively.

# Artist Statement
Ingrid Hsu’s latest series explores life through machines, specifically the human relationship with the artificial. Although she works with mixed mediums, most of her works are done through layers of oil paint– simultaneous opacity and transparency mirroring the complexities of the human-nonhuman relationship. Ingrid is motivated by interests in the intersection of computer science and philosophy, including topics such as artificial consciousness. In the rapidly developing field of technology, looming dystopian dangers battle with promises of unparalleled societal advancement; her work investigates this contestation. 

# Artist Biography
Ingrid Hsu’s fine art balances between ethereal and eerie, mystical and dystopian. Whether with dark dramatics, muted tones, or complementary combinations, Ingrid’s works are united by a deliberately controlled use of color. Her inspiration focuses on broad, abstract ideas, such as the intersection of technology and philosophy or the complexities of feminism, rather than direct, concrete messages– indications of personal opinion on subject matters lie in the decipherable details of her technical abstraction. Her influences include strange, dreamlike images of surrealism; rich, dramatic values of baroque art; and sometimes simplistic colors of Ukiyo-e. Ingrid’s intuitive, free-flowing creative process depicts abstract ideas that create an overall futuristic and otherworldly experience for the viewer.
