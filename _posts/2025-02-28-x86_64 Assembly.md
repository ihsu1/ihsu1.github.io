This project was the fifth lab of my CPSC 031 Introduction to Computer Systems course. The task was to write sum and compare functions with assembly code.  
The overall goals of this lab were to: 
* Gain experience translating C code x86_64 Assembly and go-to functions (and vice versa) to enhance understanding of underlying data structure access, and function calls.
* Understand in more detail the mechanics of C "pass-by-pointer" style parameters and function calls.

Due to class policy, please reach out for the code!
