This project was the sixth lab of my CPSC 035 Data Structures and Algorithms course. It was our first two-week lab, and the task had 3 parts: 
1. Implementing stack and queue data structures
2. Writing an application to solve a maze using either breadth-first or depth-first search
3. Answering written questions involving induction

The goal of this lab was to gain practice with the following: 
* Stacks and queues
* Depth-first search
* Breadth-first search
* Induction

Due to class policy, please reach out for the code!
