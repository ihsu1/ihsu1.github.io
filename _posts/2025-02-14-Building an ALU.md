This project was the third lab of my CPSC 031 Introduction to Computer Systems course. It was a two-week lab. The task was to construct an Arithmetic Logic Unit from scratch with Logisim. The ALU had to perform the following operations while maintaining correct condition codes: bit-wise or, bit-wise and, 8-bit addition, 8-bit subtraction, left shift, logical right shift, arithmetic right shift, and a comparator operation. 
The overall goals of this lab were to: 
* Build, test, and simulate digital circuits.
* Observe how machine code instructions are executed by digital circuits.
* Apply incremental implementation and testing to design.
