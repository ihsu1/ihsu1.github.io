This project was the ninth lab of my CPSC 031 Introduction to Computer Systems course. The task was to implement a Unix shell program that repeatedly printed a prompt, read and parsed the user inputed command string, and performed built-in shell commands on its own or forked a child process to execute non built-in commands (either in foreground or background). 
The overall goals of this lab were to: 
* Learn how a Unix shell program works by writing one, including the following features: 
    * Executing commands that run in the foreground and the background.
    * Executing built-in commands exit, cd, and history.
* Learn how to create and reap processes with the fork, execvp, waitpid system calls.
* Interact with signals and write signal handler code.
* Use gdb and valgrind for debugging C programs.

Due to class policy, please reach out for the code.
