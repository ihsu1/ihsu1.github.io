This project was the fourth lab (and first partner lab!) of my CPSC 035 Data Structures and Algorithms course. The task was to test and implement the Quick Sort algorithm and complete an accompanying written section on Big-O complexity. The goal of this lab was to gain familiarity the following: 
* the Quick Sort algorithm
* Writing unit tests
* Forrmal Big-O proofs
* Using basic LaTeX
* Partner etiquette in team labs
