This project was the fifth overall (and second partnered) lab of my CPSC 035 Data Structures and Algorithms course. The task was to write and use a linked list data structure to play an ASCII art animation with text. The goal of this lab was to understand the following in C++: 
* Implementing and testing a linked list
* Complexity requirements
* Reading .asciimation format videos
* Using the STL pair class
