This project was the seventh lab of my CPSC 035 Data Structures and Algorithms course. The task was to implement and test the binary search tree data structure with unit tests and a word-counting program. There was also an accompanying written work section on AVL trees and heaps. The goal of this lab was to practice the following in C++: 
* Implementing BSTs, including 4 traversal methods
* Writing unit tests
* Using valgrind to catch memory errors/leaks
* Understanding balanced BSTs and heaps  

Due to class policy, please reach out for the code!
