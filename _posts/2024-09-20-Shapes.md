This project was the third lab of my CPSC 035 Data Structures and Algorithms course. The task was to design a hierarchy of classes that allows users to draw various shapes(Point, HorizontalLine, VerticalLine, and Rectangle.) onto a grid printed to the command line. The goal of this lab was to understand the following in C++: 
* Classes and Objects
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism
* Memory management.
