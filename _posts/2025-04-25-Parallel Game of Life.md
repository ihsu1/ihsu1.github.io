This project was the tenth lab of my CPSC 031 Introduction to Computer Systems course, which built off Lab 7. The task was to implement a parallel version of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), a discrete event simulation where cells are born, live, and die based based on their surrounding neighbors. 
The overall goals of this lab were to: 
* Parallelize a shared-memory application using the pthreads library.
* Protect threaded code with synchronization primitives.
* Revisit 2D arrays and file I/O in C.
* Gain more expertise with C pointers and dynamic memory allocation.
* Design input files to test the correctness of the solution.
* Practice debugging threaded programs.
* Design and run parallel performance experiments

Due to class policy, please reach out for the code.
