This project was the second lab of my CPSC 035 Data Structures and Algorithms course. The task was to apply various filters (noRed, noGreen, noBlue, invert, grayscale, flipHorizontally, and flipVertically) to a particular image file format. The goal of this lab was to understand the following in C++: 
* Command-line arguments
* Dynamically-allocated arrays (and memory management)
* Organizing code into separate files
* Defensive programming (e.g. detecting invalid input)
