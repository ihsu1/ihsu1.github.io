This project was the ninth and final lab of my CPSC 035 Data Structures and Algorithms course. The task was to apply graph-based algorithms to implement a single-player game called Inroads, which involves repairing a community’s aging roads and earning points based on a given set of rules and how much of the community is able to access services via the newly-improved roadway. The goal of this lab was to accomplish the following in C++: 
* Practice software design, specifically top-down design
* Implement graph algorithms (Depth-first search, Breadth-first search, Dijkstra’s algorithm)
* Apply graph algorithms to solve graph-based problems 
* Create a single-player game
