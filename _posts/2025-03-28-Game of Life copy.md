This project was the seventh lab of my CPSC 031 Introduction to Computer Systems course. The task was to implement a program to play [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), a discrete event simulation where cells are born, live, and die based based on their surrounding neighbors. 
The overall goals of this lab were to: 
* Gain experience using 2D arrays (implemented as a contiguous chunk of N*M cells) and command-line arguments.
* Learn how to use a visualization library.
* Improve proficiency in C file I/0, pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and passing pointers to functions.
* Further practice using gdb and valgrind for debugging C programs.
* Use timing code to measure the execution time for parts of program execution.
* Design input files to test correctness of the solution, with particular consideration of different edge cases.
