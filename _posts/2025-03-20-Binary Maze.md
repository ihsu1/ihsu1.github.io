This project was the sixth lab of my CPSC 031 Introduction to Computer Systems course. The task was to solve a provided series of binary puzzles by analyzing the assembly instructions while avoiding "trip-ups" from incorrect solutions.  
The overall goals of this lab were to: 
* Gain experience reading and tracing through the execution of x86_64 assembly instructions.
* Practice with tools for examining binary files.
* Apply GDB skills to solve an assembly code puzzle.

This was my favorite lab of the course-- we were the highest scoring group in the class and the only one to complete all six levels (even discovering the hidden one)! And we did it with only 1 trip-up from our first test run. 

Due to class policy, please reach out for the code.
