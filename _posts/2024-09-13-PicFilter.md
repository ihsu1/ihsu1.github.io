This project was the second lab of my CPSC 035 Data Structures and Algorithms course. The task was to apply various filters (noRed, noGreen, noBlue, invert, grayscale, flipHorizontally, and flipVertically) to a particular image file format. The goal of this lab was to understand the following in C++: 
* Command-line arguments
* Dynamically-allocated arrays (and memory management)
* Organizing code into separate files
* Defensive programming (e.g. detecting invalid input)

<!-- Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works. -->

<!-- Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %} -->
