This project was the fourth lab of my CPSC 031 Introduction to Computer Systems course. The task was to use C pointers, arrays, and File I/O to perform basic statistics (num values, min, max, mean, median, stddev, unused array capacity) on climate change data spanning 1961 to 2022. The lab contexualized our work in the course with the staggering impact of computation and "Big Data" on climate change.
The overall goals of this lab were to: 
* Gain experience using pointers, dynamic memory allocation (malloc), and File I/O in C.
* Observe how machine code instructions are executed by digital circuits.
* Practice using gdb and valgrind to debug programs.
* Apply top-down design and maintain modualar, robust, and well-formated code, including top-level and function-level comments. 

Due to class policy, please reach out for the code!
