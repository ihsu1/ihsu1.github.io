This project was the eighth lab of my CPSC 031 Introduction to Computer Systems course. The task was to implement the parse_cmd_dynamic function from the parsecmd library that takes a command line string and parses it into a dynamically allocated argv array. The function also takes in a pass-by-pointer parameter (bg) to indicate whether the function should be run in the background. 
The overall goals of this lab were to: 
* Learn how to implement a C library (.h and .c files), and then use the library in a program.
* Learn more about C strings and char types, and use and C ctype and string library functions in programs.
* Gain more expertise with dynamic memory allocation and pointers in C.
* Further practice gdb and valgrind for debugging C programs.

Due to class policy, please reach out for the code.
