This project was the eighth lab of my CPSC 035 Data Structures and Algorithms course. The task was to read in documents and then repeatedly search it for particular keywords, finding the ten most relevant pages that contain that keyword.
The goal of this lab was to accomplish the following in C++: 
* Implement the Dictionary ADT through a LinearDictionary
* Implement the Dictionary ADT through a HashTable
* Create a KeywordSearcher class that uses these implementations and a PriorityQueue to search documents
* Write a main program that gracefully handles bad inputs

Due to class policy, please reach out for the code!
