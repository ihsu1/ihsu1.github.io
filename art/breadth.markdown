    Despite the relatively mundane and unoriginal subject matter (myself), this portrait represents expansions in my art experience. Whether through the process of personally stretching a canvas or the several weeks spent on repetitions of glazing, layering, and drying, I explored many unfamiliar techniques through this work. The effect is simple yet inherently human. The highlights of the hair and face are softened by sheer layers of yellow as opposed to dramatic opaque whites. The layers of alizarin and viridian underpainting peek through the skin, and the blues of the sweater complement the reds of the blush and yellows of the skin, which are both further integrated into the background. The simplicity of the primary colors adds to overall cohesion and general youthful-energy of the piece.

    This piece is an observational still life of objects of different tones of white. As my first introduction to oil painting, I leaned into the flexibility of oil with looser value and less line. This exercise was integral to my understanding of color perception, specifically color’s relation to lighting and relative objects. Painting white objects requires much more than just white paint.

  <summary><h1 style="display: inline; margin-bottom: 0;">Mutilation</h1></summary>
    What makes a face scary? What makes horror horror? To create this work, I studied different faces that evoked visceral responses of fear. Then, using colored pencil and choosing the typically simple, serene Japanese art style of Ukiyo-e, I simplified the components of a scary face down to the basics– eyes and mouths. Inspired by Hokusai’s “A Hundred Horror Stories,” I created a monster of my own. The creature represents the internalized misogyny common to many Japanese myths, with a woman who has succumb to her jealousy and turned into a demoness exhibiting self-hatred. This conflicting subject matter and art style creates wonderfully thought-provoking internal contestation.

    The flow of stark red blood suddenly fades into monotonous grays; her vitality has slowly trickled out, a day at a time. Death is instantaneous; depression is drawn out. How do you approach her teetering on the edge of life and death? How do you handle chronic goodbyes, the impermanence of her presence? Her wings have been forced into her- are they fading or materializing? Do they represent the blood still in her veins, the external interference forcing her to stay alive, the translucent fragility of her mortality? Or are they the wings that will transition her to the Other World, with patterns reminiscent of red spider lilies that symbolize death and rebirth? Can I pull her back, keep her from saying goodbye? Or will she drag me with her through the pain of the loss. Do I stop myself from taking her hand? This work, a larger-than-life foreshortening drawing, is inspired by a real friend.

  <summary><h1 style="display: inline; margin-bottom: 0;">White Lotus (白蓮花)</h1></summary>
    A modern Chinese term for a cruel woman who acts innocent while tearing down other women (a.k.a. a “pick-me”), the White Lotus character stems from internalized misogyny, a perpetual self-constricting hatred for divided self. Ironically, the term itself also sustains cycles of misogyny. This painting shows this contradiction and the start of my developing art style, with dark colors, floral motifs, and an echo of The Birth of Venus.

  <summary><h1 style="display: inline; margin-bottom: 0;">Medusa</h1></summary>
    Emulating Caravaggio’s Medusa, this portrait looks the least similar to myself out of all of my self-portraits. With the anachronistic glasses and significantly less exaggerated facial emotions, the overall tone of the piece is no longer intensely horrific, but rather lightly disbelieving. While actually due to a disparity in facial mobility, I in fact prefer my depiction. Medusa is yet another woman historically portrayed as a monster, with some interpreting her look of horror in the Caravaggio portrait as a sign of self-hatred. But in the real myth, she was a victim wrongfully punished. So I personally prefer the polite outrage of my portrait over a victim’s self-repulsion.

    1000 miles apart, we still gaze at the same moon. This work is an emotional expression from my first year away when homesickness was really kicking in. It uses the same photo as my Glazing Self Portrait, but a year earlier. Like that portrait, it was a learning piece– I learned to work with value and work larger than life. My art has come far. I have come far. But I still miss home sometimes, the same home I missed when I painted this.
