    I’ve never felt quite as alive as when I first rode a motorcycle. A machine, engineered by human hands from nuts and bolts and all sorts of other small components, not only enhances spirit but also holds passionate soul. It feels so alive. The roar of the engine embodies the adrenaline of freedom. This work of graphite and gunmetal is inspired by labeled diagrams of human anatomy, drawing a parallel between human and machine; these two beings made up of scattered parts and intricate mechanisms can, at times, feel mutually symbiotic and equally alive.

    We are currently racing to achieve true artificial intelligence. Ghostly hands of anonymity grasp towards it, hoping to transcend to the realm of gods with this insurmountable power. So close, yet so elusive, intangible. Can they capture the mysterious orb, engraved with indecipherable patterns of promise? Or will they pass right through it? Balanced fragilely, like walking across a spiderweb or shattered glass, they risk the fall into an unmanageable, super-intelligent catastrophe. But as everything centers around this illuminated object, a competing force confuses the foreground and background. Streaks of color go towards the focused orb, but wispy swirls go elsewhere. A brain-like jellyfish (or jellyfish-like brain) floats around carelessly with its own jellyfish consciousness, capable of previously undiscovered thought. The irony of a creature with no centralized brain portrayed as such highlights the relationship between central and unconventional intelligence. Perhaps the inspiration for artificial intelligence lies in an abnormality. Or perhaps, in our distracted race towards the orb, the finish line turns out to be the start of our doom.

  <summary><h1 style="display: inline; margin-bottom: 0;">Technology Brings: LIFE & DEATH</h1></summary>
    Technology maintains human life (ex: life support) and ends it as well (ex: warfare weaponry). There are two sides to its usage– it’s not ethically binary. Currently, the impact of technology depends on how humans use it, and humans are much too complex to follow simple standards of good and bad. The uses of machines are interconnected; this diptych shows the traditionally positive and negative sides. The macro-pen hatching, value, and line of an almost comic-strip style act as a backdrop for these key differences, whether through content or presentation. Green is life; red is death. The central focus is the patient (person); the central focus is the grenade (machine). The ethical considerations of technological advancement are complicated, and balancing technology’s potential for dangerous social impact with its promises of benefits for human wellbeing is difficult. Ultimately, both types of technology depend on circumstantial human behavior to decide impact. But what happens when that’s no longer the case?

  <summary><h1 style="display: inline; margin-bottom: 0;">The "Woman"</h1></summary>
    Whether Grace, Sophia, or Desdemona, many of the latest humanoid-robots revealed at the United Nations AI for Good conference were women. While this could be a tactic to destigmatize unknown technology through lowered threat perception, it could also be a more harmful form of gender bias towards a new, ideally dehumanized woman. The Woman is based on Aphrodite, the goddess of love and beauty. Perceived as the ideal physical woman in ancient times, she foreshadows women of the future. Will The Woman be subject to the same standards of the old, caught up in the dusty cobwebs of expected inferiority? A male-dominated industry risks projection of “the male-gaze” onto realistic robots, creating a dangerous dynamic. This danger is represented by contrasting color and spaced-out eyes in the work. Stripped to her barest form, The Woman is dehumanized. But can she be dehumanized if she is not technically human? Can she fall to the qualms of the female experience if she is not technically a woman?

  <summary><h1 style="display: inline; margin-bottom: 0;">Takeover</h1></summary>
    My biggest fear is something happening to my family. Possibly my most radical-dystopian work yet, this piece shows the insecurity of losing family not simply through death, but through gradual loss of personal, human identity with our data devoured by technology. The faces in this piece are portraits of my family as ghostly souls wafting towards the central, newly-forming being. Few react strongly, already dull to the slow succumbing of the digital takeover. Our lifeless color contrasts with the vibrant fleshy tones of the humanoid non-human, whose robotic arms grip our translucent bodies, ready for consumption. The being festers, its gory mouth freshly emerging and its eye piercing– God, why can it have an eye, the window to the soul, without a soul? In the background, along with flowers of loss and rebirth, are essays of Thomas Reid: what is identity? How does it relate to our physical body, our memories, our data? How can an identity be lost; how can it be stolen?

    This triptych is my take on Yoshitomo Nara’s signature big-headed girls (my mom’s favorite art). I embody his “juxtaposition of human evil with the innocent child” through machines/weapons of mass destruction reimagined as living beings. Instead of the child holding weapons, the child is the weapon. Human evil– evil equipping life-ending, technological capabilities– is expressed through this stark dichotomy framed by youthful colors.

  <summary><h1 style="display: inline; margin-bottom: 0;">Intelligence Attained</h1></summary>
    This final, cumulating piece returns back to Pursuit of Intelligence, my first series work. It’s a collage of thematic series elements. The same orb, bigger this time, has been captured by a mysterious black figure; generalized AI has been achieved, although the circumstances are inideal. Born from what are supposed to be waves of liquid metal (although the execution doesn’t really match what I imagined), the birth of AI mirrors Aphrodite’s creation from sea foam, and from it falls desperate “new-age women,” female embodiments of the orb (reference to The “Woman”). They land in dark fluidity, mysterious and terrifying, resembling a swirling cauldron or the depths of the ocean (with tentacles, seashells, and jellyfish. Spiderwebs (fragility) are broken; jellyfish (unconventional intelligence) are contaminated; the swirls (chasing intelligence) are chaotically dispersed. On the “sea” floor lies the leftover remains of dystopian destitution– skulls, a ball and chain, an embryo– they are flat, 2D, with less movement than the rest of the piece, an indication of abandonment. The only hope rising from the depths, the only repeated motif that remains unchanged from the rest of my series, are the flowers– white lotus leaves and red spider lilies, demonstrating death but also rebirth, possible hope.
