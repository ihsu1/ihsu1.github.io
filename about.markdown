Hi! My name is Ingrid, and I am a first-year double majoring in computer science and philosophy. While I'm still not set on a path within CS, I'm currently most interested in working with AI, cognitive science, and the ethics of technology. I'm also hoping to explore interests in cybersecurity and tech policy. With my work, I value creativity, challenge, and positive social impact. I specifically prioritize promoting accessible education, especially in STEM, and creating community for women in computing. Check out my résumé for more information on my work! In my free time, I enjoy visual arts/fashion, meditation, and trying new cuisines.
